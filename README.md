Overview of Task Two: Simple Linear Regression Model

Objective:
The primary goal of Task Two is to implement a simple linear regression model using the California Housing dataset. This involves training the model to predict continuous target variables (house prices), evaluating its performance, and visualizing the results.

Dataset:
The California Housing dataset includes various features related to housing in California, such as average house age, average number of rooms, average number of bedrooms, population, average occupation, and median income. The target variable is the median house price.

Key Goals:

1.Prepare the Data:

Split the dataset into features (independent variables) and target variable (dependent variable).
Divide the data into training and testing sets to train the model and evaluate its performance.

2.Train the Model:

Use a linear regression algorithm to train the model on the training data.

3.Evaluate the Model:

Make predictions on the test set.
Evaluate the model's performance using metrics such as Mean Squared Error (MSE) and R-squared (RÂ²).

4.Visualize the Results:

Create visualizations to compare actual vs. predicted values.
Plot residuals to assess the accuracy and reliability of the model.

Outcome:
By completing Task Two, you will have a working linear regression model capable of predicting house prices based on various features. You will gain insights into the model's performance through evaluation metrics and visualizations, helping you understand its strengths and limitations. This project demonstrates the application of linear regression in a real-world context, providing a foundation for more advanced predictive modeling and data analysis tasks.
